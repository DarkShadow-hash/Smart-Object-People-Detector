# Smart Object Detector

## Two projects, one mission: From generic detection to personalized AI vision

### Visual Overview & Demonstration

This project implements a lightweight and highly accurate Computer Vision system, based on the YOLOv8 Nano architecture, specialized to detect three custom personal objects (Water Bottle, Headphones, Pencil Case) in real-time.

Core Goal: Demonstrate the effectiveness of Transfer Learning to specialize a generic model on a small, controlled dataset.
