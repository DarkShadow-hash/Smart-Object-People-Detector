# Smart-Object-People-Detector

## Two projects, one mission: From generic detection to personalized AI vision

### Overview
This repository contains two progressive projects that demonstrate the evolution from generic object detection to personalized AI vision:

#### Project 1: Smart Object & People Detector
A minimal YOLOv8-based application that detects people and objects in images or webcam video using Python and OpenCV. You will quickly see the limitations of this small project because it only succeeds at detecting people correctly.

#### Project 2: Custom Object Detector
Build AI that sees what you see, perfectly. Create your own personalized object detection AI that actually understands your stuff.

### Why Two Projects?
Project 1 Shows the Problem:
Generic detection that confuses objects

"Is that a phone or a chair?" 

But why ?
It's because it's limited to 80 pre-defined COCO classes.

Project 2 provides the solution:
Personalized AI trained to detect specifically YOUR objects

"That's definitely your iPhone with 95% confidence!" 

Recognizes anything you care about
